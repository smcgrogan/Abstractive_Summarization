Abstractive Text Summarization for Domain-Specific Articles: This project focuses on creating a high-performance
abstractive summarization model for environmental science articles using three state-of-the-art language models,
PEGASUS, FLAN-T5, and BART, fine-tuning them on a curated subset of environmental science papers from the Semantic
Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC). We evaluate the models using both automated metrics (ROUGE, BERTScore)
and human assessments, noting that, while traditional metrics may not fully capture summary quality, human
evaluations reveal the strengths of our fine-tuned models.
